Hey everyone! Quick Example on how we can automate the handling of different files to automatically be uploaded to amazon S3.

Packages (& Versions) used in this video:
boto3 1.11.13
os

Few notes on Creating IAM users:
- Create a user
- Enable programmatic access
- Add user to a group with the desired permissions
( In this video we used S3, but you can use this client with many more aws services. You would assign those permissions to a group the same way as we do the s3 permissions here)
- Copy access and secret access keys

Code:

from secrets import access_key, secret_access_key

import boto3
import os

client = boto3.client('s3',
                        aws_access_key_id = access_key,
                        aws_secret_access_key = secret_access_key)


for file in os.listdir():
    if '.py' in file:
        upload_file_bucket = 'youtube-dummy-bucket'
        upload_file_key = 'python/' + str(file)
        client.upload_file(file, upload_file_bucket, upload_file_key)
